## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Complete the setup from the main [README](../README.md)
2. Ensure Kafka is running: `confluent local services list`
3. Verify Java examples compile: `mvn clean compile`

### Running Exercises

1. **Read the documentation first**: Check `../docs/dayXX-*.md`
2. **Follow exercise steps**: Each exercise builds on previous knowledge
3. **Run the Java examples**: Use the provided Maven commands
4. **Verify results**: Check output matches expected results

### Example Commands

```bash
# Compile the project
mvn clean compile

# Run Day 1 example
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.training.kafka.Day01Foundation.BasicTopicOperations"

# Run tests
mvn test

# Check Kafka status
confluent local services list
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Kafka not running**
   ```bash
   confluent local kafka start
   ```

2. **Port conflicts**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :9092  # Check what's using Kafka port
   ```

3. **Java compilation errors**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile  # Clean and recompile
   ```

4. **Topic already exists errors**
   ```bash
   confluent local kafka topic delete <topic-name>
   ```

### Getting Help

- Check the troubleshooting section in each exercise
- Review the documentation in `../docs/`
- Verify your environment setup
- Check Kafka logs: `confluent local services kafka log`
